Blockchain technology has the potential to improve transparency and accuracy of transactions by using a public ledger.  This is especially desirable for property conveyances given the value and use to the general public.  While several companies and governments have concluded successful blockchain proofs of concept, few are left with impactful programs or large scale adoption.

Blockchain is a trusted ledger of transactions. Cook County, Illinois Recorder
of Deeds concluded a successful proof of concept in 2016 with the opinion that
